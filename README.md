📋 Project Guidelines

No Frameworks or Libraries: Do not use React, Bootstrap, jQuery, Tailwind, or any external JS/CSS frameworks.

Clean, Valid Code: Your HTML and CSS must pass W3C validation.

File Naming: All files should end with a new line and follow consistent naming conventions.

README.md: This file is mandatory and must be placed in the root directory.

🎨 Design & Assets

Figma Design: The UI is based on a design provided in Figma. Duplicating the file into your own Figma workspace is recommended for better inspection of layout, spacing, typography, and color schemes.

(Insert Figma URL here)


Images/Assets: All assets (images, icons) must be downloaded and placed in the images/ folder.

(Insert download link if available)



Design Considerations:

Fonts: This project uses Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT. Use Google Fonts or @font-face to include them in your stylesheet if not already available.

Precision Values: Some spacing or sizing may be given in float values (e.g., 13.57px). It’s acceptable to round these values to simplify your CSS without losing design accuracy.

📌 Notes

This project focuses on pixel-perfect layout reproduction, so attention to detail is key. Be mindful of alignment, spacing, and responsiveness across screen sizes.
